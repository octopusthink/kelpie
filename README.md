# Kelpie

A block editor-friendly starter theme for WordPress. Alternatively: [Scottish water-horse spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelpie). ðŸ¦„

Kelpie is designed for agency-types building custom WordPress themes for clients. If you're looking to build a theme to distribute more widely, this may not be the right choice for you.

Kelpie aims to avoid the whack-a-mole process of building WordPress themes by relying heavily on design tokens and mixins, scoping styles tightly to individual components rather than creating a lot of broad global style rules. 

This is very much an experiment-in-progress. If you're interested in using Kelpie for your own projects, do feel free, but keep in mind that it is extremely experimental at the moment.

## Local Development

Once you've set up a local development environment, you're ready to start working on the code. You'll want to start by installing dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, to watch and build SCSS files, start the script:

```bash
npm start
```

Any changes you make to files in the `scss` folder will automatically be compiled. It's best to avoid making changes to `style.css` directly and instead modifying the source `.scss` files.

## Run PHP CodeSniffer

To ensure PHP is meeting the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/), install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) on your machine and run `composer install` to install the dependencies needed for the linter. Then run:

```bash
composer lint
```

to ensure your PHP code matches the expected code standards.

You can often have the script magically fix any simple errors by running lint-fix:

```bash
composer lint-fix
```
