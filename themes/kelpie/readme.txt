A block editor-friendly starter theme for WordPress. Alternatively: [Scottish water-horse spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelpie). ðŸ¦„

== Description ==

Kelpie is designed for agency-types building custom WordPress themes for clients. If you're looking to build a theme to distribute more widely, this may not be the right choice for you.

Kelpie aims to avoid the whack-a-mole process of building WordPress themes by relying heavily on design tokens and mixins, scoping styles tightly to individual components rather than creating a lot of broad global style rules. 

This is very much an experiment-in-progress. If you're interested in using Kelpie for your own projects, do feel free, but keep in mind that it is extremely experimental at the moment.
